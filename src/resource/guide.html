            <h3>BMI</h3>
            <a id="bmi" name="bmi">  Or Quetelet index, is a heuristic proxy for human body fat based on
                an individual's weight and height. BMI does not actually measure 
                the percentage of body fat. It was devised between 1830 and 1850 by 
                the Belgian polymath Adolphe Quetelet during the course of 
                developing "social physics".Body mass index is defined as 
                the individual's body mass divided by the square of his or her height. 
                The formulae universally used in medicine produce a unit of measure 
                of kg/m2. </a>

            <a name="formulas"> Formulas used to calculate the Ideal Weight:</a>
            <ol>
                <li> J. D. Robinson Formula (1983)</li>
                <li>D. R. Miller Formula (1983)</li>
                <li>G. J. Hamwi Formula (1964)</li>
                <li>B. J. Devine Formula (1974)</li>
                <li>Social formula: The "Peoples Choice" formula for Ideal Weight 
                    was designed by Dr. SB Halls. 
                    It is partly based on the publication by Dr. D. Crawford and 
                    K. Campbell1, entitled "Lay definitions of ideal weight and 
                    overweight", from the International Journal of Obesity in 1999

            <h3 id="bmr">BMR</h3>
            <a name="bmr"><em>BMR</em> stands for Basal Metabolic Rate.
                It is the amount of daily energy expended by humans and other animals 
                at rest. Rest is defined as existing in a neutrally temperate 
                environment while in the post-absorptive state.</a>
            <h3 id="tdee">TDEE</h3>
            <a name="tdee">Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is a calculation of the
                caloric requirements to maintain weight.
                <h3 id="eer">EER</h3></a>
            <a name="eer">Estimated Energy Requirements.
                is a method to determine how much energy intake your body 
                requires on a daily basis. The formula to find out includes 
                he following variables: sex, height, weight and the amount of 
                physical activity you do. As such, by finding out your EER, 
                you can determine how much activity you need to perform on a 
                daily basis to lose weight, gain weight or maintain your 
                current weight.</a>

            <h4>Ectomorph</h4>
            An ectomorph is a typical skinny guy. Ecto’s have a light build with 
            small joints and lean muscle. Usually ectomorph’s have long thin 
            limbs with stringy muscles. Shoulders tend to be thin with little width.
            Typical traits of an ectomorph:
            <ul>
                <li>Small “delicate” frame and bone structure</li>
                <li>Classic “hardgainer”</li>
                <li>Flat chest</li>
                <li>Small shoulders</li>
                <li>Thin</li>
                <li>Lean muscle mass</li>
                <li>Finds it hard to gain weight</li>
                <li>Fast metabolism</li>
            </ul>
            Ectomorphs find it very hard to gain weight. They have a fast 
            metabolism which burns up calories very quickly. Ecto’s need a huge 
            amount of calories in order to gain weight. Workouts should be short
            and intense focusing on big muscle groups. Supplements are definitely 
            recommended. Ectomorphs should eat before bed to prevent muscle 
            catabolism during the night. Generally, ectomorphs can lose fat very 
            easily which makes cutting back to lean muscle easier for them.
            If well fed, he does not gain weight 
            <h4>Mesomorph</h4>
            A mesomorph has a large bone structure, large muscles and a naturally 
            athletic physique. Mesomorphs are the best body type for bodybuilding.
            They find it quite easy to gain and lose weight. They are naturally 
            strong which is the perfect platform for building muscle.

            Typical traits on a Mesomorph:
            <ul>
                <li>Athletic</li>
                <li>Hard body with well defined muscles</li>
                <li>Rectangular shaped body</li>
                <li>Strong</li>
                <li>Gains muscle easily</li>
                <li>Gains fat more easily than ectomorphs</li>
            </ul>
            The mesomorph body type responds the best to weight training. 
            Gains are usually 
            seen very quickly, especially for beginners. The downside to 
            mesomorphs is they 
            gain fat more easily than ectomorphs. This means they must watch 
            their calorie 
            intake. Usually a combination of weight training and cardio works 
            best for mesomorphs.
            <h4>Endomorph</h4>
            The endomorph body type is solid and generally soft. Endomorphs 
            gain fat very easily. Endo’s are usually of a shorter build with 
            thick arms and legs. Muscles are strong, especially the upper legs.
            Endomorphs find they are naturally strong in leg exercises like the squat.

            Typical traits of an Endomorph:
            <ul>
                <li>Soft and round body</li>
                <li>Gains muscle and fat very easily</li>
                <li>Is generally short and “stocky”</li>
                <li>Round physique</li>
                <li>Finds it hard to lose fat</li>
                <li>Slow metabolism</li>
            </ul>
            When it comes to training endomorphs find it very easy to gain weight. 
            Unfortunately, a large portion of this weight is fat not muscle. 
            To keep fat gain to a minimum, endomorphs must always train cardio as well as
            weights. Usually supplements may not be needed as long as the person has a high 
            protein intake in their diet.
